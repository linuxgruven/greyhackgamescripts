Scripts I made or Updated for the game "GreyHack"

Fantom is my abomination of a script for a game called "Grey Hack". I do not care what happens with Fantom anymore.
//FantomNew.src is the one you'll want

Special thanks to the user 'saschahi' for fixing Fantom while I was away

Do feel free to open an issue if something breaks or you want to suggest something.



//update log:
//added oof (network-wide destroyer)

//added processlogger - Notifies you when processes have opened/closed on your machine (rshell finder)

//added ps - Same as /bin/ps but cant be replaced


//assuming libs were installed by Fantom you can now update metaxploit at any time with the 'updatemx' command

//Fantom adds the hackshop's repository as an apt source

//rewrote some broken auto hacker stuff

//added 'connectwifi' command (usage: connectwifi [essid] - cracks and connects to specified wifi)

//started work on AMC (automatic mission completion)



//ideas:

//considering removing net-rob and other bank features due to how little money you can find in them

//'net-rob' was a command that hacked every machine on a network that it could and read out the contents of every users bank file


//thinking about exploit DB support

//This would be in its own seperate Fantom shell.

//Updating the DB with new service versions would be as easy as running a command in Fantom for a couple minutes depending on hardware

//This 'command' would scour the web for service versions it doesnt have in the db and note down the addresses an unsafe values into the DB


//Prompt user to update metaxploit.so for them on startup if its outdated
