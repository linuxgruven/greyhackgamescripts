Scripts I made or Updated for the game "GreyHack"

Fantom is my abomination of a script for a game called "Grey Hack". I do not care what happens with Fantom anymore.
//FantomNew.src is the one you'll want

Special thanks to the user 'saschahi' for fixing Fantom while I was away

Do feel free to open an issue if something breaks or you want to suggest something.



update log:
//Fantom will now prompt you to update exploit libs when they're out of date at startup
// Fantom will no longer scan for libs at boot when the computer has no wifi
  // Trying to search anyways will start Fantom with hacking commands disabled
// Added some extra details as to why lib scanning can take a while



ideas:

considering removing net-rob and other bank features due to how little money you can find in them
'net-rob' was a command that hacked every machine on a network that it could and read out the contents of every users bank file

thinking about exploit DB support
This would be in its own seperate Fantom shell.
Updating the DB with new service versions would be as easy as running a command in Fantom for a couple minutes depending on hardware
This 'command' would scour the web for service versions it doesnt have in the db and note down the addresses an unsafe values into the DB

Prompt user to update metaxploit.so for them on startup if its outdated
