**THIS SCRIPT IS FOR A GAME AND IS NOT FOR REAL HACKING**

**Install instructions**
 1) Download the ZIP file or use the git command utility to clone the repo
 2) Go into Grey Hack and make a folder called 'commands' in your users home folder (mkdir commands)
 3) Not including fantom.gs recreate every file in the FantomModular folder inside that commands directory ingame
    	Be sure you copy the file name as is or it won't work!
 4) Open fantom.gs and visit line 753. see all of those lines where it says "import_code(...)"?
 5) You need to fix the paths so it points to the same file in your users home directory
    Example: if your users name is "bob" then the beginning needs to be "/home/bob/commands/filenamehere"
 6) copy and paste the new fantom.gs into CodeEditor and try building it
